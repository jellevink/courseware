### Description

Platform as a Service is an environment in the cloud with all the resources you need for development or deployment of cloud based applications.

The resources are purchased on pay-as-you go basis, where access to them is granted through a secure internet connection.

Service is mainly targeting developers.

**PaaS** includes *IaaS* services with the addition of: 
- **middleware**
